A \textbf{\textit{generic algorithm}} is an algorithm that is not part of any particular kind of container, but instead takes a cue from its arguments' types about how to access the data is uses. The standard library's generic algorithms usually take iterators among their arguments, which they use to manipulate the alements og the underlying containers.\\
\\
\textbf{\textit{Iterator adaptors}} are functions that yield iterators with properties that are related to their arguments in useful ways. They are defines in $<iterator>$ and the most common one is back\_inserter, which takes a container as its argument and yields an iteraror that, when used as a destination appends values to the container. \\

The \textbf{\textit{decrement operator}} works like the increment operator, but it decrements its operand instread. It comes in prefix and postfix versions. The prefix version decrements its operand and returns the new value.
