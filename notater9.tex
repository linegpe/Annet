\title{Chapter 9: Defining new types}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
C++ has two kinds of types: built-in types and class types. One of the languae's strenghts is that user-made class types should be as easy to use as built-in types. To achieve this, we must implement classes in a way that they are as user-friendly as built-in types and this is what chapter 9 is all about. \\
\\

\textbf{\textit{Constructors}} are special member functions that define how objects are initilaized. These is no way to call a constructor explicitly. Instead, creating an object of class type calls the appropriate constructos automatically as a side effect. Constructors have the same name as the class itself, and they have no return type. \\
\\

The constructor that takes no arguments is known as the \textbf{\textit{default constructor}}. Its job is normally to ensure that its object's data members are properly initialized. \\
